beneath the hood

after we told them 
artificial tree

a bit of rust
on the Chevy's fender
harvest moon
 
20145
a lightning strike gives up a flower
 
20146
forest clearing
a scapula
left for the moon
 
20147
that time of year
moonlight fills
his empty chair

20148
birding . . .
the unfamiliar path
home
 
20149
winter solstice
the tilt
of her hospital bed

first morning
firecracker papers
wander the streets

flies wait it out 
under a cow's chin 
spring shower

the saw changes 
its tune

the earth marked 
by fallen angels

an accordion squeezes 
the night air

the click of stilettos 
on cobblestones
 
20136
flowing estuary 
native languages 
long gone
 
20137
in the hot tub 
my eyes on her floating breasts 
Hunters Moon

rosebud unfolding 
the seed packet left behind 
in Revelations

20121
no escaping 
this moonlight— 
Pompeii
 
20122
river mud 
the shape 
of boys 
 
20123
somewhere becoming rain becoming somewhere
 
20124
desert twilight 
a map with many creases 
nailed to a cross

20125
we huddle 
over mother's open grave— 
lawless winter
 
20126
a long bus ride 
the prophetic language 
of the stops

20111
Navajo moon 
the coyote call 
not a coyote
 
20112
deleting words 
from the eulogy 
falling leaves
 
20113
calla lily 
the sound of a ladder 
lengthening
 
20114
tasting the well
in the water— 
summer stars
 
20115
Mother's Day 
the expiration date 
on wildflower seeds
 
20116
northern lights . . . 
the scratchy play 
of seventy-eights
 
20117
a recurring escape from my father's dream
 
20118
the big dipper 
no matter where I stand           
mountain sky

20119
summer passing 
the yard flamingo's 
rusty legs 


201110
glint of sunlight: 
the respirator carries on 
alone

20101
All Souls Day... 
my name called 
from the front gate
 
20102
autumn 
an empty booster seat 
in the barber's window
 
20103
hunter's cabin: 
of the woods 
not of it
 
20104
end of the walk 
returning the crow's feather 
where I found it

cafe for sale— 
outdoor tables rusting 
into autumn

day lilies 
another death date added 
to the family tree

20091
The house finch 
has a song for it, 
morning after snow
 
20092
crescent moon 
a bone carver sings 
to his ancestor
 
20093
close enough to touch— 
I let the junco lead me 
away from its nest
 
20094
Blowing leaves 
tempt the old cat, 
but not enough
 
20095
ancient mountains . . . 
runners clearing hurdles 
on the practice field

Thanksgiving— 
fifteen minutes 
of mince pie

blossoms . . . 
the baby's bare feet 
pedal the air

one moth 
a thousand candles 
light the darkness

trail's end— 
my pebble 
settles the cairn
 
20071
family reunion— 
some of the beached kelp 
in knots
 
20072
a jar of pennies 
on the lemonade stand 
evening cool

the scarecrow's coat sleeve 
caught in mid-wave

summer's end 
the hammock turned in 
on itself

Charcoal Alley— 
children flick marbles 
into the light

20061
season of lights 
the postman 
leans to the wind
 
20062
having no thought 
we've come to see them— 
dogwoods in bloom
 
20063
turning tide— 
placing intact clams 
back in the water

20064
mallard pair 
he rocks 
on her wake
 
20065
filtering in 
with the night air 
a skunk's warning
 
20066
stone in my pocket— 
the brook cuts deeper 
into the mountain
 
20067
a bee chose 
the rose I meant to pluck . . . 
empty vase
 
20068
soba noodles . . . 
the new year 
slips in

no one bothered to plow 
the graveyard road

child's wake 
the weight 
of rain
 
20052
gunshot the length of the lake
 
20053
a stick caught 
on the lip of the dam 
winter's end
 
20054
summer stars . . . 
the old violin goes 
to the highest bidder
 
20055
winter drags on . . . 
I squeeze the last drops 
from a teabag
 
20056
distant thunder— 
a titmouse gives one chirp 
and falls silent
 
20057
Alzheimer's birthday 
each slice of the cake 
takes part of her name

March winds 
a decade has passed 
by your grave

Indian summer 
a spent salmon 
washes ashore
 
20042
after the funeral 
whiskers still 
in his razor
 
20043
the page-finders 
of my father's Daily Missal 
losing their colors
 
20044
first buds of spring    
I change the washer's setting           
to delicate
 
20045
Among the gravestones 
with names worn away 
children play hide 'n seek
 
20031
whalebone 
from a beach near Savoonga— 
winter rain
 
20032
All Saints morning 
a path 
of trodden leaves
 
20033
cremated
in her favorite kimono— 
small green plums
 
20034
spring rain— 
the gravedigger latches the door              
of his backhoe
 
20035

loon calls 
my daughter drawing circles 
near the fire

summer evening— 
from across the meadow 
a call to supper
 
20023
shivering on the roof 
I rub my palms together 
meteor shower
 
20024
ocean breeze— 
a strand of seaweed     
steadies the kite
 
20025
autumn rose—      
even as I sketch the wind         
more petals fall
 
20026
Humid July— 
from the stove the smell 
of old fires
 
20027
the wind of autumn 
a homeless man warms himself 
hand to mouth

20011
broken easel— 
the front yard blue 
with wildflowers
 
20012
heat waves— 
the hitchhiker shifts her child 
to the other hip
 
20013
land's end— 
sand in each bite 
of my apple
 
20014
Indian summer 
a fish slips through 
the gill net
 
20015
her 18th birthday— 
for the first time she notices        
my silences
 
20016
spring sunshine       
the climbing ivy       
filled with sparrows

a gentle wave 
wets our sandals

mountain hike 
we drink from the beginning       
of a great river
 
20003
spring sun—        
high in his arms              
the newborn is shown

its heart beats too

the shape of his feet     
in his sneakers

Geronimo's grave 
someone has left    
plastic flowers

19991
new in town 
the scent 
of unknown flowers
 
19992
foghorns . . . 
we lower a kayak 
into the sound
 
19993
catalog time 
the garden begins 
without a seed

19994
new butterfly . . . 
folded wings 
lean into the wind
 
19995
morning overcast 
a few seeds still dangle 
from the dandelion
 
19996
break up 
I leave behind 
her butterfly net
 
19997
walking home barefoot, 
we enter the shadow 
of the hill
 
19998
autumn evening . . . 
a page of the old book 
separates from the spine

19981
funeral procession . . . 
snowflakes blowing 
into the headlights
 
19982
autumn evening 
my hospital window 
becomes a mirror
 
19983
storm clouds 
the cry of a shearwater 
circles the sky
 
19984
late into the night 
we talk of revelations 
moon through the pines
 
19985
the kettle whistles . . .            
a blur of garden color            
on the window
 
19986
winter beach 
a piece of driftwood 
charred at one end
 
19987
riveredge old growth: 
a towering window 
of stars
 
19971
I'm caught in it too— 
the blossom-loosening wind
 
19972
Over the railroad tracks 
the slow motion 
of a snake
 
19973
The beetle I righted 
flies straight into 
a cobweb
 
19974
leaf in my palm 
its stem extends 
my lifeline
 
19975
about the tree 
over my small son's grave 
—tell me
 
19976
musty smell 
forgotten . . . deep 
into the text
 
19977
that Venus! 
leading the cupped moon 
through every turn of the road
 
19978
"grabs" and "opens" 
the fist 
sowing seeds

19961
the river— 
coming to it with nothing 
in my hands
 
19962
deep silence           
the orphaned nestlings           
this third morning
 
19963
summer solstice— 
the long tips of lavender 
bent by bees
 
19964
snowbound 
coloring inside 
the lines
 
19965
the dumproad pond 
tadpoles exit 
a birdhouse
 
19966
still sun-warmed . . . 
the pulled-out scarecrow 
in my arms
 
19967
Changing the swallowtail       
changed by it            
the spring wind

19951
letting the branch go 
a shower of petals falls 
on the old woman
 
19952
toll booth lit for Christmas 
from my hand to hers 
warm change
 
19953
winter seclusion 
tending all day 
the small fire
 
19954
on the path 
only one of us 
touched by a falling leaf
 
19955
winter, bedtime    
static flickers        
through a white sleeve
 
19956
warm river— 
up to our necks 
in sunset
 
19957
beneath the ice 
the waterfall                     
still falling

19941
Old garden chair 
sagging with the weight 
of a single leaf.

19942
after the stroke. . . 
watching only the half of your face 
that smiles

19943
City window 
mountains and pines 
etched in frost

19944
Autumn deepens 
an empty snail shell 
explored by an ant
 
19945
early morning sun      
scattered on the table           
several grains of salt
 
19946
snowflakes 
no one will miss 
melt in her hand
 
19947
bright leaves     
blow through        
her dream house

19931
scattering his ashes     
the moon           
in bits and pieces
 
19932
on the river       
of many names, one cloud       
floating
 
19933
learning too late 
he didn't like bubinga wood— 
sun strikes the urn
 
19934
the war memorial— 
migrating butterflies 
cover the names
 
19935
falling leaves 
the house comes 
out of the wood
 
19936
leaving you— 
fog on either side 
of the white heron
 
19937
Below zero 
all curled up in the woodpile 
the skin of a snake

19921
deep winter.                      
the armload of firewood                      
chills the kitchen
 
19922
mourning dove calls . . .      
my elderly neighbor stills           
the sound of her hoeing
 
19923
August morning— 
a window washer wiping dust 
from his sunglasses

19911
snowmelt . . .      
she enters      
the earth on her knees
 
19912
an old woolen sweater           
taken yarn by yarn                     
from the snowbank
 
19913
a white horse 
drinks from the acequia           
blossoming locust
 
19914
sunlight shines red 
through my father's thumb 
on the steering wheel
 
19915
two women crying 
one giving birth           
the other being born
 
19916
Approaching the family plot . . . 
my furled umbrella 
turns into a cane.
 
19917
Chernobyl victim— 
fingers pressing the plastic 
to his wife's caress
 
19918
cloud shadow            
long enough to close 
the poppies

19919
The thick clang 
of a cowbell 
the sun deepens

199110
Roses 
in the smaller room 
more fragrant
 
199111
Ninety winters           
Spellbound                      
Again
 
19901
silent cathedral      
stained-glass apostles      
dimming with dusk
 
19902
up the path 
to touch that one oak 
in last night's dream
 
19903
dry leaves 
the old archer 
curves his eyebrow
 
19904
soft rain— 
the new grave 
looks old
 
19905
morning sneeze— 
the guitar in the corner 
resonates
 
19906
dusk 
a lone car going the same way 
as the river
 
19907
First days of summer . . .      
already the leaves gather          
beneath the sycamores
 
19908
fall leaves the trees the winter sky
 
19891
so many ways 
within the waterfall 
for water to fall
 
19892
after the rain 
on my vegetable patch 
a new crop of stones
 
19893
frozen in mud 
by the vacant shanty: 
lottery ticket
 
19894
the potter's hands 
gently shape the vase      
out of himself
 
19895
Watermelon rind, 
sitting in its own juice 
the summer sun
 
19896
figure drawing class— 
in the model's deepest shadows 
a stark white string
 
19897
Ebb tide . . .     
a little sea          
in the shell

19898
watching rain 
pouring down . . . pouring down 
just watching


19899
abandoned store—      
large sign reading           
WE NEVER CLOSE

19881
a single strand 
of spider silk      
stops her
 
19882
endlessly becoming, 
clouds
 
19883
mime 
lifting 
fog
 
19884
taking time . . . 
listening 
to the grocery clerk
 
19885
in the Yukon 
sleeping with one eye shut 
the summer night
 
19886
in soap bubbles 
again and again 
his face is broken

19871
yard sale, 
sunlight filling 
mason jars
 
19872
leaving home . . . 
the smell of smoke 
from old brick chimneys
 
19873
frozen pond—
white antlers rise 
through the ice
 
19874
June night 
my mother alone with 
her cancer
 
19875
at dinner 
biting into the roast beef . . .
the butcher's thumb nail
 
19876
phoning the neighbors
their real voices 
through the open window
 
19877
repeating the lecture 
his eyes following 
the window-cleaner's blade
 
19878
Tools rusting 
Unused on the work bench 
A faucet dripping
	
19879
full moon 
peering into 
the half-built house
 
198710
dusk 
drawing the pond's depth 
to the surface
 
198711
old woman, wrapping 
her cat's gifts 
—centering the bows
 
198712
on the way to work 
a hot air balloon 
up in the mist
 
198713
this heat; 
the dog's tail 
the only breeze

19861
light 
up under the gull's wing:
sunrise
 
19862
second husband 
painting the fence 
the same green
 
19863
such coolness 
the snail stretches 
its neck
 
19864
the one legged bird 
that deep bend before 
taking off
 
19865
bird song 
lost 
in bird song
 
19866
walking in on her 
dead eyes reflecting
snowfall
 
19867
in the sea 
the fireworks 
rising
 
19868
bird feeder untouched . . .
alone again

19869
circling each thigh 
cool 
of the night river

198610
small child 
afraid to throw away 
his Church Bulletin

19851
in utter stillness 
the incense 
changes direction
 
19852
early spring sun—
the spinster combs out her hair
for nesting birds
 
19853
canyon: 
at the very edge
riversound
 
19854
Out of its slipper 
her bare foot talking 
under the table
 
19855
Burial prayers 
grandson playing hide and seek
behind the stones
 
19856
between the fireflies 
the changing shape of darkness
 
19857
My father's hammer 
warm again 
in my hand
 
19858
under trees and sky 
the baby studies 
her hands

19841
migrating geese—
once there was so much
to say
 
19842
sound of her voice
carrying eggs 
across the ice
 
19843
moving 
with the clock tower's shadow
the flower lady

19831
heart drawn in dust 
by the old Indian . . . 
rain
 
19832
whispered dusk—       
a fox picks its way            
across the ice
 
19833
mist 
lifting 
the loon's cry
 
19834
snowman's eye 
sinking in 
the spring rain
 
19835
Autumn afternoon: 
I stand on the shadow 
of the sparrow
 
19836
ten below zero: 
man and boy walk through their breath 
to read old tombstones
 
19837
hot wind 
the roadrunner's beak 
opens and closes
 
19838
Blackbirds descend 
through the floaters 
in this eye

19839
the old man 
closes the shadow 
in his hand
 
198310
spring drizzle 
rounding the thorn 
a drop of light
	
19821
horizon 
wild swan drifting through       
the woman's body
 
19822
deserted wharf 
the mime bows 
to the moon
 
19823
a spider's web 
across the windharp 
the silence
 
19824
under the back steps      
catfish still flop in the pail—           
the long August night
 
19825
horns fold 
at my shadow's touch; 
brown slug
 
19826
early April rain 
that woman fills every jar,         
seals them forever
 
19827
dead mynah bird . . . 
with each passing car 
its wing flaps
 
19828
Picking cotton—       
the memory            
of birdtracks in the snow
	
19829
Old tea bag;      
tints the moon           
slightly
 
198210
blackened walnut 
left unopened— 
winter solstice
 
198211
Distant woodchopper 
inside the cabin 
axbite echoes
 
198212
The grey cranes at dusk— 
bending in a line along      
the crooked fenceposts
 
198213
checking for water 
the woman finds a full moon 
trapped in the cistern
 
19811
Old woman, 
rain in the eye 
of her needle
 
19812
The path shorter now, 
underfoot the crumbling leaves; 
the child runs ahead
 
19813
cry of the peacock widens the crack in the adobe wall

19801
fields of snow      
not only moonlight           
but the moon
 
19802
cold morning sea— 
an old man towels 
himself in the sunlight
 
19803
fields of corn stretching 
as far as the eye can see 
within            a lost child
 
19804
crossing the bright sky 
of a near-sighted swimmer,      
the song of a bird
 
19805
and yet 
perishable is flesh— 
a mountain plum
 
19806
what thing cries out 
deep inside us 
cooking the turtle?
 
19807
Lights out 
. . . the firefly 
inside
 
19808
the wind 
somewhere else— 
bird tracks in a light snow
	
19809
apples cooking: 
in the aroma 
pictures of my mother canning
 
198010
Dawn      
another parting 
with the moon
 
198011
back and forth goldfish hot & humid afternoon

19791
the child 
points at the moon 
and says, "bird"
 
19792
one seagull 
on a shaft of air; 
dawn
 
19793
Lean man 
Carving 
The tree's dream.
 
19794
morning-glory folds into herself into her folds
 
19795
from behind me 
the shadow of the ticket-taker 
comes down the aisle
 
19796
Walking to Work 
Pages lap at your feet 
The quick eye holds up the news to the day
 
19797
Part of a dog 
walking by upside down 
in the roadside puddle
 
19798
Where the ripple was 
the fisherman casts his line; 
another ripple

19799
Quiet strokes 
of night swimmer: the slap 
of beaver tails . . .
	
197910
never expecting 
the lilies in November 
nor the small coffin
 
197911
the room's smallness 
fills with light       
this morning of snow
 
197912
The way of the conch— 
blueing in the sea, and 
echoing in the wind
 
19781
leaving      all the morning glories      closed

19771
Old frog 
up to his ears 
in moonlight
 
19772
reaching into sky 
the girl breaks the wish—
bone of geese
	
19761
in a dark bag 
onions 
sprouting
 
19762
still lake—
a hawk makes off 
with its image
 
19763
skiers! 
standing 
on the wind
