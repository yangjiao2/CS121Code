	 * Takes the input list of words and processes it, returning a list

	 * 
	 * This method expects a list of lowercase alphanumeric strings.
	 * If the input list is null, an empty list is returned.
	 * 
	 * There is one frequency in the output list for every 
	 * unique palindrome found in the original list. The frequency of each palindrome
	 * is equal to the number of times that palindrome occurs in the original list.
	 * 
	 * Palindromes can span sequential words in the input list.
	 * 
	 * The returned list is ordered by decreasing size, with tied palindromes sorted
	 * by frequency and further tied palindromes sorted alphabetically. 
	 * 
	 * The original list is not modified.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 * Given the input list of strings 
	 * ["do", "geese", "see", "god", "abba", "bat", "tab"]
	 * 
	 * The output list of palindromes should be 
	 * ["do geese see god:1", "bat tab:1", "abba:1"]
	 *  
	 * @param words A list of words.
	 * @return A list of palindrome frequencies, ordered by decreasing frequency.
